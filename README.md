Z3 Installer
============
Mickaël Delahaye, 2011

Microsoft Z3 is a powerful SMT solver. The authors of this tool let a Linux
version available to researchers, and it comes with its own Ocaml binding.
However, building and installing it is just too boring to do more than once.
Here is somes files that automates the task.

To the point
------------

First, get the installer either by downloading it from [Github][1]
or by cloning it :

	git clone git://github.com/polazarus/z3-installer.git

Then use it:

	cd z3-installer
	make # download Z3 and build the Ocaml library (native and byte)
	sudo make install # install Z3 binary, DLL and the Ocaml library

Requirements
------------

- Ocaml (shocking!)
- Camlidl
- GCC, GNU Make
- Ocaml Findlib (optionally)

More
----

If you have already downloaded Z3, please put the tarball in the `tarballs`
directory before running `make`. Beware of choosing a wrong build of Z3 for your
system. In doubt, let the installer choose for you.

### Targets

*   `update`, search a new version if available

*   `install`, `uninstall`
*   `bin-install`, `bin-uninstall` (just the Z3 binary)
*   `lib-install`, `lib-uninstall` (just the library and its headers)
*   `ocaml-install`, `ocaml-uninstall` (just the OCaml binding, the installation
    requires lib-install),

*   `clean` (remove build artifacts)
*   `distclean` (clean + remove libraries and downloaded files)

### Makefile options

*   `WITH_GMP`

    If you have any problem with GMP, you can replace the last line by:

        sudo make install WITH_GMP=true # use Z3 DLL with GMP statically linked

    Seems to be not available in the 64 bit build.
    Warning! did not need it, did not test it...

*   `BIN`, library installation directory by default `/usr/local/bin`
*   `LIB`, library installation directory by default `/usr/local/lib`
*   `INCLUDE`, library installation directory by default `/usr/local/bin`

        sudo make install BIN=/opt/bin LIB=/opt/lib INCLUDE=/opt/include

### Ocaml library

This installer uses Findlib if it finds it, so it may install the Ocaml library
either in `ocamlc -where` or `ocamlfind printconf destdir`. With Findlib, you
can choose to force the destination directory using `OCAMLFIND_INSTALL_FLAGS`:

    sudo make install OCAMLFIND_INSTALL_FLAGS='-destdir `ocamlc -where`'
    # Install the Ocaml library in `ocamlc -where`

You can also deactivate the use of Findlib altogether:

    sudo make install OCAMLFIND=

To generate the Ocaml documentation, in `./doc`:

    make ocaml-doc

And yes, it is actually helpful! ;)

Contents
--------
*   `README.md`, this very file
*   `README`, a symlink to this very file
*   `Makefile`, the main Makefile
*   `Makefile.ocaml`, the Makefile for the Ocaml library
*   `download.sh`, a shell script (tested with bash and dash) that selects,
    downloads, extracts the suitable tarball from the Z3 project's website
